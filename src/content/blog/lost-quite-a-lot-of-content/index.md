Well as the title states, I’ve lost quite a lot of this site’s content. My site is powered by [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) and for some reason on a night last week there was a database error, OK no problem I thought, I’ll just reload the latest backup I have. It turns out the latest backup I have is from over 2 months ago, and roughly 6 weeks ago I made a lot of structural changes to the pages (but didn’t create a backup immediately, that’ll teach me!), including the [free templates](/templates/) page, which is quite popular and where most of this sites 15,000+ unique visitors per month end up going. I’d had them (the free templates) organised into their own separate pages instead of “blog” posts announcing them but that’s all lost now until I get around to rewriting all of the content for them, oh well, it happens I guess.

For now though, if you want any of my [free templates](/templates/) then I suggest you head on over to [Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/) and find your way to [my user profile page](http://www.opendesigns.org/profile/?user=christopher). Not all of the free templates are listed on Open Designs yet, that’s my fault for not uploading them all, so if you want any of the ones not listed then you can find them in the [download directory](/download/) on this site.

Anyway, sorry again if you’re trying to access any links from [portfolio](/portfolio/) or [free templates](/templates/) pages, I’ll do my best to get this sorted as soon as possible!

On a side note, I’m also testing out [Google Adsense](http://www.google.com/adsense/) on this site, something which I have not really used before on my personal site, but we’ll see how it goes. Any extra money to cover the hosting costs/hours of my personal time spent creating my free website templates can’t be a bad thing. So they’ll be showing up on various pages over the next couple of weeks and I’ll have a test run of about 2 months before deciding on whether to keep them up or not. Comments about them / ideas where to put them which aren’t too obtrusive are also more than welcome!
