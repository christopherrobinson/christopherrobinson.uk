[Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/) recently had a competition to decide the final design for the new site. The winner was [Pat Heard](http://www.fullahead.org/), and now the conversion process is going on to get his winning design into place on the new site.

Everything is now coming together with the site, where the new design has been chosen and is going up, although it will be a few days until it is implemented as there are still a lot of tweaks needed to get it working perfectly, as always, it’s being worked on day by day.

For those of you new to [Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/) and are wondering why you can’t see any posts in the [forum](http://www.opendesigns.org/forum/), it’s because you need to have a registered account and be logged in to access it. If you’re not logged in, you won’t be able to see the forum or be able to participate in discussions. The user accounts integrate with both the main site (Powered by [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/)) and the forums (Running off [Vanilla](http://www.getvanilla.com/)) so there’s no reason not to be registered, if you’re not already, then what are you waiting for? Go and [register your account](http://www.opendesigns.org/wp-register.php) now! Once you have signed up you will have full access to the forums as well as being able to upload designs of your own.

Moving forward, into and beyond the New Year, lots of new features will be added to the site which is yet to be finalised so it’s looking like the New Year will be off to a great start for [Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/).
