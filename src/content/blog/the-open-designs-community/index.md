A new community has been formed, [Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/). The goal is to create a community owned and managed site, where users can share their designs, discuss web design, and promote their services.

[Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/) is owned and operated by The Open Design Community, a non-profit organisation headed by a board of 3 administrators (1 of whom is me) and 10 moderators (who are yet to be announced).

The main features that will be on the site will be:

* Free web designs
* A forum for web designers and developers
* A blog network for our members
* A resource directory for web designers
* A web design wiki
* ...and possibly much more, it all depends on your feedback.

So far it’s been less than a week since it was started and we have already completed a basic shell for the site and backend functions which allow users to upload their designs, and the admin approval system. I will post a more detailed post regarding this at a later date, but right now this is just to get the word out about [Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/) so go check it out and be sure to register for the main site & forums, as well as upload some designs if you wish!

And we have a contest up to design the new look of the site! Check out [this forum post](http://www.opendesigns.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=21) for more information. In the meantime, we will keep the design plain.
