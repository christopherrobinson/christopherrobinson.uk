Hello! I'm Christopher 👋🏻 I have **over eighteen years of professional experience** developing websites and applications of varying size and scale based on web-standard technologies; from clean coded HTML and reusable CSS components with responsive techniques and progressive enhancement, through to the modern headless web with **React**, **styled-components**, and **GraphQL** endpoints.

I am an **Umbraco Certified Expert** and have been creating Umbraco websites using ASP.NET (MVC, C#, Angular) for over 16 years. Although this site is [built using Astro](https://astro.build/) and the source code is available on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/christopherrobinson).

Having nearly two decades of professional commercial experience in the industry, I have worked for and alongside digital agencies both in the United Kingdom and abroad. Throughout projects I test on a multitude of devices and have used various assistive technologies including eye-tracking which has proven invaluable for understanding and optimising the decisions users make while browsing, particularly on eCommerce sites where the primary focus is to increase conversions.

> Please note that I am currently working for [Danfoss Limited](https://www.danfoss.com/) but will take on freelance/contract work if it interests me and doesn't pose a conflict. If you're interested in working on a future project with me then feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) and we'll take it from there.

Outside of web development a large passion is motorcycles, and I've owned a few different bikes over the years. I currently have a **Suzuki GSX-R750** sitting in the garage and have taken various trips over to continental Europe on it (taking in parts of Austria, Andorra, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and more) which included riding many alpine passes and mountain roads as well as blasting around the [Nürburgring](http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/) at silly speeds. Closer to home I enjoy taking it to [Oulton Park](http://www.oultonpark.co.uk) and [Trac Môn](https://www.angleseycircuit.co.uk/) to do the odd track day. I also enjoy hiking, sports such as squash and tennis, mountain biking, and have also taken a handful of skydiving lessons.

Free HTML Templates
-------------------

When I was first starting front-end web development I created various website templates for practice and experience which I gave away for free on sites such as [Open Source Web Design](http://oswd.org), [Open Web Design](http://openwebdesign.org) and [Open Designs](http://opendesigns.org) (where I was a founding member and site administrator).

These templates were all created around 2006. The web has changed vastly in the time since and as such I wouldn't recommend they are used today, they're merely kept online for archival purposes. However should you wish to, you are free to use them for any purpose you wish without accreditation - this statement overrides any prior conditions, for example what is set out in the template itself.
