title: Templates

When I was first starting front-end web development I created various website templates for practice and experience which I gave away for free on sites such as [Open Source Web Design](http://oswd.org), [Open Web Design](http://openwebdesign.org) and [Open Designs](http://opendesigns.org) (where I was a founding member and site administrator).

These templates were all created around 2006. The web has changed vastly in the time since and as such I wouldn’t recommend they are used today, they’re merely kept online for archival purposes. However should you wish to, you are free to use them for any purpose you wish without accreditation - this statement overrides any prior conditions, for example what is set out in the template itself.
